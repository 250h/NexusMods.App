To help you get the most out of your modding experience, the app offers a Health Check system which runs diagnostics against your current loadout and presents potential problems along with recommended solutions. The extent of the diagnostics will vary by game. See [Games](../games/index.md) for details on specific diagnostics.

    If there's a diagnostic you think should be included with one of our supported games, please let us know on [GitHub]() or the [forums](). 

We've added several rules.
